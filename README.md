# BRB - Boredom Removal Bowling

This is an implementation of a 10-pin bowling game. 
This is a single-player game with a console-based UI, so nothing fancy visually right now but yeah, you would enjoy it nevertheless.
A user starts the game and with an enter-key based navigation control progresses to the next tosses. If he likes, he can keep playing more games.
An enhanced version with a cool UI coming pretty soon!
